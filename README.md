Understanding the biological function of a protein using structural bioinformatics

Abstract. Structural bioinformatics studies molecular structures and interactions to explain the function of a biological molecule in question, and when necessary find a way to block this function for medicinal purposes. In this workshop, we will combine homology modeling to create a model of a protein, and molecular docking to study interactions of the protein with a set of small ligands, potentially pharmacologically potent. Bring your own laptop and have USCF Chimera installed!
